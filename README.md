# Junior-Security-Analyst-Intro
Junior Security Analyst, their responsibilities and qualifications needed to land a role as an analyst.

We will spend a lot of time triaging or monitoring the event logs and alerts.

# The responsibilities for a Junior Security Analyst or Tier 1 SOC Analyst include:

Monitor and investigate the alerts (most of the time, it's a 24x7 SOC operations environment)
Configure and manage the security tools
Develop and implement basic IDS (Intrusion Detection System) signatures
Participate in SOC working groups, meetings
Create tickets and escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed

# qualification's:

Basic understanding of Networking ( OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) or  TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)), Operating Systems (Windows, Linux), Web applications. To further learn about OSI and TCP/IP models, please refer to the .
Scripting/programming skills are a plus

Preparation and Prevention

Prevention methods include gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). It also includes the maintenance procedures like updating the firewall signatures, patching the vulnerabilities in the existing systems, block-listing and safe-listing applications, email addresses, and IPs. 

Monitoring and Investigation 

A SOC team proactively uses SIEM (Security information and event management) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities.
 
level: Low(3), Medium(2), High(1), and Critical.

Response 

After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes action on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more. 

# Task 3

We will get a chance to monitor the network traffic, including IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts, suspicious emails, extract the forensics data to analyze and detect the potential attacks, use open-source intelligence to help you make the appropriate decisions on the alerts.

What was the malicious IP address in the alerts?

```
221.181.185.159
```
To whom did you escalate the event associated with the malicious IP address?

```
Will Griffin
```
After blocking the malicious IP address on the firewall, what message did the malicious actor leave for you?
